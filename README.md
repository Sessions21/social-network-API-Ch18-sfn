## Description 
 This node.js based RESTful API can be used by web based social networking application to create, read, update, and delete users. It also provides the same functionality to do the same with personal thoughts users wish to share online.  It provides the functionality to create friend groups, share thoughts on any topic with this group of friends, and post reactions to other friend's thoughts. It uses MongoDB for the backend storage, and uses Mongoose and Express.js to organize and route the data to the frontend.
